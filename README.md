# SmartCart — Bachelor’s Thesis (Final Year Project)

SmartCart is my **final-year Bachelor’s thesis project**, currently under development. The project aims to solve long checkout queues and manual billing delays by enabling an **automated, self-assisted smart shopping cart system**. Each cart is linked to a user session through a QR code, while items are added to the cart by **scanning product barcodes on the user’s phone via the web app**, ensuring transparency and real-time billing.

The system uses an **ESP32-CAM module** on the cart for product image capture and event monitoring, along with an onboard **LCD display** that provides prompts, alerts, and system notifications during shopping. The core idea is to make checkout **faster, reliable, and fraud-resistant**. After payment, a secure QR code is generated and verified at the exit gate.

A **conference paper based on this project has already been accepted and published**.
